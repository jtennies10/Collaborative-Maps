        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>The maps page is relatively easy to navigate but in case you need some assistance here you go. In the image below you can see a display of the given map. By clicking on the links in the locations section you will be taken to that area on Google
            Maps. I suggest trying to open up the StreetView at some of the places to get a cooler view. To use StreetView drag and drop the little orange guy in the bottom right corner. The search bar on the map works just like any other search bar and
            gives you an easy way to find locations.

        <h3>Adding Locations</h3>
        <p>To start navigate to the area that you would like to share with others. Once you get to it, adjust the zoom using the plus/minus icons in the bottom right. The zoom you choose will be the same zoom that others see when they open your location.
            Note, however, you cannot save StreetView locations directly so for that just zoom in a lot and the end user can choose whether or not they would like to see the StreetView for themselves. After adjusting the zoom click on the map where you
            would like the center to be. This will drop a marker that will autopopulate the latitude, longitude, and zoom fiels of the Add Location Form, as seen in picture one. These fields cannot be edited any other way. Then just put your name and
            a short description in the form and click "Add Location". The location will then be added to the database for others to check out!
